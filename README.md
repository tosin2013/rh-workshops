# Red Hat Workshops, but make it spicy

[![Deploy to DigitalOcean Kubernetes](https://github.com/kenmoini/rh-workshops/actions/workflows/dok8s.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/kenmoini/rh-workshops/actions/workflows/dok8s.yml)


[Red Hat Workshops](https://learn.kemo.network) are a great open source collection of educational materials that cover various topics relating to Red Hat's product portfolio, from Automation with Ansible to Containers and Kubernetes with OpenShift.  There is a set of resources to deploy the workshop environments, currently supported by IBM Cloud.

## Workshop Listing

### Currently Available and Supported Workshops

- Ansible Automation

### Workshops that need maintenance

- Containers 101
- DevOps on OpenShift (Screenshot updates for OCP)
- DevSecOps/SSF
- OpenShift 101 (Screenshot updates for OCP)

### Available but Untested

- Container Security
- Linux Containers the Hard Way
- OpenShift Security Workshop
- OpenShift Service Mesh
- RHEL 8
- SELinux Policies

***NOTE***: Some of the workshop catalog items are from the [Red Hat Gov Workshops](https://github.com/RedHatGov/redhatgov.github.io) and thus either haven't been tested recently on this platform, on the IBM Cloud, or on the latest OpenShift version where applicable.  AWS deployment options may be available.

## Deploying This Workshop Curriculum Platform

The live site at learn.kemo.network is deployed to a Kubernetes cluster - any will do.  The manifest files can be found in `scripts/kubernetes/`.

The container is built on a Red Hat UBI that runs Apache HTTPd and serves up the static content generated by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/overview/introduction/).

Outside of Hugo, there is some Javascript in the workshop curriculm platform to manage participant "logins", activity around the site, and to manage workshop auto-configuration assets from [Jig](https://github.com/kenmoini/jig).  Jig is the backend service that powers this platform.

Both the curriculm and Jig can be run locally, from a container, or in a Kubernetes cluster.

### Local/VM Deployment

Assuming you're starting with a fresh Fedora 32 instance, the following commands will clone down the repo, install the needed Asciidoc and NodeJS:

```bash
## Install packages
sudo dnf install -y git asciidoc rubygem-asciidoctor nodejs npm

## Clone down repo
git clone https://github.com/kenmoini/rh-workshops
cd rh-workshops

## Install Frontend Scripts
cd themes/pf4-redhat/static/
npm install
cd ../../..

## Build Site
bin/hugo

## Deploy with httpd/nginx/etc or run:
hugo serve
```

Navigate your browser to http://localhost:1313 to access the workshop curriculum site.

***NOTE***: You will still need to modify the `config.toml` file to match a deployed Jig backend in order to access the functions of logins, activity analysis, and workshop auto-configuration.  Jig can also be [deployed locally](https://github.com/kenmoini/jig#how-to-use).

### Deployment as a Container Image

In the root of this repository, you'll find a `Dockerfile` which can be used to build a container image:

```bash
podman build -t rh-workshops .
podman run -p 8080:8080 rh-workshops
```

Navigate your browser to http://localhost:8080 to access the running container.

***NOTE***: The Jig backend endpoint is defined in the Hugo config which is consumed during static site generation in the container builder layer.  In order to override it when deployed as a container you will need to mount a volume to `/var/www/html/js/container/` containing a `jig-backend-override.js` file that has the following:

```javascript
const jigBackendEndpoint = "https://jig.example.com"
```

### Deployment to Kubernetes

Assuming you have a Kubernetes cluster that has an nginx-ingress Ingress Controller the manifests found in the `scripts/kubernetes/` folder should deploy this workshop curriculum platform, pulling the container image from quay.io/repository/kenmoini/rh-workshops.

To override the deployed Jig backend endpoint variable create a ConfigMap with the following:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: jigBackendEndpointCM
  namespace: rh-workshops
data:
  jig-backend-override.js: |
    const jigBackendEndpoint = "https://jig.example.com"
```

And modify the Deployment to look as follows:

```yaml
---
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: rh-workshops
  namespace: rh-workshops
  labels:
    app: rh-workshops
    app.kubernetes.io/name: rh-workshops
    app.kubernetes.io/part-of: rh-workshops
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: rh-workshops
  strategy:
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: rh-workshops # has to match .spec.selector.matchLabels
    spec:
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 30
      containers:
        - name: rh-workshops
          imagePullPolicy: Always
          image: quay.io/kenmoini/rh-workshops:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
              name: web
          volumeMounts:
          - name: jigBackendEndpointJS
            mountPath: "/var/html/www/js/container"
            readOnly: true
      volumes:
        - name: jigBackendEndpointJS
          configMap:
            name: jigBackendEndpoint
            items:
              - key: "jig-backend-override.js"
                path: "jig-backend-override.js"
```
